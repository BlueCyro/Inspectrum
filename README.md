# Inspectrum

This is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that makes the color of your inspector panels reflect your custom user color cloud variable. Now you can inspect with the power of rainbows on your side!

### Installation: 
Simply drop the dll from the latest release into your nml_mods folder


### Usage:
Open an inspector panel and it will be colored with whatever your `G-Neos.CustomUserColor` cloud variable is set to. This can optionally be overridden via the mod's [NeosModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings).


### Credits:
#### Gareth48 for the idea
#### badhaloninja for figuring out how to make the dang inspector update


For those of you not aware of how to build with vscode, you can simply follow the instructions in the build script and the SymlinkedLibraries folder.
Once you have everything set to your system, just run the Build.ps1 or `dotnet build` in a powershell on the root of the project.
